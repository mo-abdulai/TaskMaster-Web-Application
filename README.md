# Validating a Private-Public Key Pair 
This technology is a cryptographic method providing a new level of security for key-pair validation, securing both traditional and quantum- resistant protocols for key establishment. Public key validation is a well-known security practice for modern key establishment protocols. While necessary in many proposed post-quantum systems, post-quantum cryptographic algorithms generally do not support direct public key validation. Migrations of modern Internet peer-to-peer communication protocols, such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to quantum-resistant technology will require a new key validation technique to be secure.
